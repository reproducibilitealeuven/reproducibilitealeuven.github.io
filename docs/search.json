The original ReproducibiliTea group was founded by Sophia Crüwell, Amy Orben, and Sam Parsons at the University of Oxford in 2018, and has now grown into a global initiative across 99 institutions and 24 countries.\nThe Leuven chapter of ReproducibiliTea began in 2020. Our primary activity is a journal club that takes place roughly 2x per semester, during which we discuss articles or other resources (e.g. podcasts, online tools) relating to open science practices. Each journal club session is led by a member of the ReproducibiliTea Leuven organising team and focuses on a different challenge or (potential) solution to addressing issues of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability.\nSubscribe here to attend the next sessions: https://tinyurl.com/reprotealvn"
